VALUES, TYPES AND OPERATORS

*/

// All data stored in a computer are sequences of bits.

// Bits are two-valued things. They are represented with 1 and 0 . Think of it as black and white or true and false.
// Any piece of information can be esessially zeros and ones represented in Bits.
// LEARN HOW TO CALCULATE BINARY NUMBERS

// VALUES //

// In javascript these are pieces of information that we call values
// Every value has its type that determines its responsability and duties.
// As long as you no longer use a value be desappear, but it will be in memory if you need to call it again.

// NUMBERS

// Javascript uses 64 bits.
// 64 bits are like 18 quintillion so you can represent your number and be able to store it in memory.
// Numbers and calculations for whole numbers or integers smaller than 9 quadrillion wil be precise.

// ArithMetic
// Pendas in math apply here.
// Modulo is the remainder of a division X % Y = (X / Y) = remainder

// Strings
//  backslash \ is 'escaping' character

// Javascript models strings into a sequence of bits.
// This is based on the Unicode standards.
// putthing two strings together 'a' + 'b' concatenates the strings = 'ab'

// Backticks- quotes strings are called 'template literals'

// If we use two value operators these are called ' Binary Operators' example - x > y, x + y
// If we use one value operator this one is called ' Unary Operator' example !, NaN
// if we use three value operator, this one is called ' Ternary Operator ' console.log(true ? 1 : 2)

// console.log(NaN == NaN) // False
//  Ternary Operator
// console.log(true ? 1 : 2) // 1
// console.log(false ? 1 : 2) // 2

// Empty Values

// null and undefined  - indicates that the variable in memory doesnt have a meaninful value yet
// They are interchangable
// example :
// let empty;
// console.log(empty); // undefined

// O, NaN and "" count as false
